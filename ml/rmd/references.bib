   abstract = {Of 795,000 strokes occurring annually in the United States, 87% are classified as ischemic strokes [1]. Aging is the most robust non-modifiable risk factor for incident stroke, which doubles every 10 years after age 55 years. Approximately three-quarters of all strokes occur in persons aged ≥65 years. As the number of people aged ≥ 65 years is projected to grow, the number of incident strokes in older adults is expected to rise, presenting major challenges for clinicians and policy makers in the foreseeable future. Aging and cerebral vasculature. The complex network of the adult brain vasculature measures approximately 370 miles, receives about 20% of total cardiac output, and exchanges 20% of total blood glucose and oxygen. With aging, both cerebral micro-and macro-circulations undergo structural and functional alterations. Age-related microcirculatory changes are presumably mediated by endothelial dys-function and impaired cerebral autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. Whereas endothelial dysfunc-tion promotes neuro-inflammation, impaired cerebral autoregulation may lead to microvascular injury, and impaired neuro-vascular coupling fosters a decline in cortical function, all potential targets for future therapeutic interventions. Aging, in otherwise healthy individuals, is associated with numerous noticeable changes in human intracranial and extracranial cerebral arteries that predict the risk of future stroke. Aging and silent cerebrovascular disease. Silent cerebrovascular disease represents structural abnormalities , presumed vascular etiology, on neuroimaging not supported by clinically recognized stroke symptoms. The prevalence of silent cerebrovascular disease increases with advancing age and is recognizable as the following parenchymal lesions: 1) Silent infarcts (silent strokes), prevalence 6% and 28%, exceeds symptomatic stroke by a ratio of 10:1, 2) white matter hyperintensity or hypodensity on neuroimaging represent micro-vascular disease occurring in 20% to 94% older adults, and 3) cerebral microbleeds indicate silent intracerebral hemorrhages in 38% of general population aged >80 years. These conditions are age dependent and forecast increased risk of future symptomatic strokes (Figure 1). Aging and stroke risk factors. A worldwide population-based study identified 10 risk factors that collectively account for 88% of the risk of stroke in all Editorial collectively account for 88% of the risk of stroke in all ages, which suggest that stroke is largely a preventable condition [2]. A number of additional studies recognized other important risk factors and predisposing conditions for the development of stroke. The prevalence of certain stroke risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary and peripheral artery disease steadily increases with age. The risk factors are not equivalent in predicting the stroke risk across all age groups. The relative risks of stroke conferred by body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, or cigarette smoking declines with increasing age. Nevertheless risk factors often cluster among older adults, thereby, significantly modifying the occurrence of stroke. Emerging evidence indicates that hyper-tension, diabetes, and obesity may cause structural and functional alterations in the brain beyond their effect on incident stroke [3]. Despite abundant research focused on risk factors for incident stroke, the data on subsequent clinical outcomes after incident stroke are limited and even contradictory [4]. Aging and comorbidities. Multi-morbidity defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions is a norm in older people and highly prevalent in persons with incident stroke, estimated at 89% for those aged ≥ 65 years and 60% for those aged < 65 years [5]. Survivors of stroke may accrue additional comorbidities during their lifetime , a hypothesis that needs evaluation in a prospective study. These comorbidities, single or combined, potentially interact with conventional cardio-vascular risk factor(s) to modify the risk of stroke. Comorbidities significantly influence subsequent hospital readmission, functional recovery, and mortality [5]. Aging and therapeutic implications. Unlike in younger adults where the evidence for primary and secondary stroke prevention is well established, and supported by robust randomized clinical trial data, the evidence base is less clear in older adults especially those aged ≥ 75 years. The benefits of primary prevention with antiplatelet, statin, or antihypertensive therapy to reduce the risk of incident stroke require an estimated life-expectancy longer than the time to benefit. National guidelines provide a grade C (selected patients) recommendation for aspirin use in adults aged},
